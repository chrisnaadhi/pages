    I'm Chrisna, Full-time Learner. Aspiring Web Developer and Enthusiast of IT
    in Library & Information Science.

    Graduated from Library & Information Science make me realized that
    infrastructure of information and library need to be built to supporting
    library services. Nowaday, people rarely visit the Physical Library, rather
    they usually googling when doing some stuffs. But that doesn't make the
    Library obsolete, things are Library need to transform and evolve through
    years to satisfies the user needs. This way i'm thinking to learn and build
    the infrastructure for Library to provide better services about information.
    If we, as Librarian, learn to build and provide information through any
    platform, the Library is still going to be relevant and exist through years
    or decades as we transform to the better the services.

    Excited by the evolution of web every single days, push me through to built
    something useful for the community and users.
